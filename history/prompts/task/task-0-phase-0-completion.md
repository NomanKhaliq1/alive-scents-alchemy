User message: "now complete phase 0"
Codex response summary: Completed Phase 0.
- Fixed `node_modules` corruption by full reinstall (resolved `next dev` error).
- Installed `@supabase/supabase-js`.
- Implemented `lib/db/supabase.ts`.
- Verified build success (`npm run build`).
- Updated `docs/task.md` to Completed.
Task reference: Phase 0
High-level reasoning: User requested completion of Phase 0. I identified that the build was broken, fixed it, and then implemented the remaining Supabase and env tasks. Verification was successful.
What changed: `node_modules` refreshed, `lib/db/supabase.ts` created, task status updated.
