# Phase 14: UI Polish (Forms)

## Task Description
Polished the UI specifically for Form Elements (`Input`, `Select`) to match the new "Glass/Alchemy" theme.
User requested "improve ui please" specifically after seeing the forms.

## Changes
1.  **Form Elements (`components/ui/FormElements.tsx`)**:
    - Replaced basic borders with `bg-white/5` (Glass).
    - Added `border-white/10` and glowing focus states (`ring-violet-500`).
    - Added styled Select dropdown arrow.
    - Added specific dark mode styling for `<option>` tags (browser default often breaks dark mode selects).

## Status
Completed.
