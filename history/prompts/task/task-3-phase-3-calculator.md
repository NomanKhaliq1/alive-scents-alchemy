Codex response summary: Completed Phase 3 (Formula Calculator).
- Created `app/calculator/page.tsx` with dynamic formula selection and real-time calculation logic.

- Visualized breakdown of ingredients.
- Updated `docs/task.md`.
Task reference: Phase 3
High-level reasoning: User requested Phase 3. I implemented the calculator to transform percentage-based formulas into practical batch quantities, a core requirement of the "Alchemy" aspect.
What changed: Calculator logic and UI added.
