# Phase 6 Finalization: Estimated Ready Date

## Task Description
Review Phase 6 completeness against `task.md` and finish any remaining items.

## User Request
"phase 6 check karo task.md ma agr kch rehta ha to complete kro ni to mark krdo"

## Changes
1. **Identified Gap**: `app/bonding/page.tsx` was displaying progress but not an explicit "Estimated Ready Date".
2. **Fixed**: Added logic to calculate and display `Est. Ready: {date}` in the UI.
3. **Documentation**: Updated `docs/task.md` to check off all items and mark Phase 6 as **Completed**.

## Status
Completed.
