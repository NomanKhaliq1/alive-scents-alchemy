User message: "bs proceed kro"
Codex response summary: Completed Phase 2 (Formula Management).
- Created basic UI components (`Button`, `Card`).
- Created `app/formulas/page.tsx` (List).
- Created `components/forms/FormulaForm.tsx` (Creation logic + Validation).
- Created `app/formulas/create/page.tsx`.
- Verified build.
- Updated `docs/task.md` to Completed.
Task reference: Phase 2
High-level reasoning: User gave permission to proceed. I executed the entire Formula Management module, focusing on the strict validation rules (100% total) and enabling the core data entry workflow.
What changed: Form creation and listing logic added.
