User message: "now start on next two task from phase 0"
Codex response summary: Executed Phase 0 Tasks 5-6 (Next.js & Tailwind).
- Used `create-next-app` via a temporary directory strategy to respect `ANTIGRAVITY.md` structure rules.
- Merged scaffolded files (`app`, `public`, configs) into root.
- Verified Tailwind v4 configuration.
- Updated `package.json` name.
- Updated `docs/task.md`.
Task reference: Phase 0
High-level reasoning: User requested next two tasks. I ensured strict folder compliance by scaffolding cleanly and merging. Verified Tailwind setup (v4 detected).
What changed: Project codebase initialized.
