User message: "base on all files update tasl.md also"
Codex response summary: Updated `task.md` to v1.2. Incorporating `ANTIGRAVITY.md` constraints (env.example) and linking tasks to explicit paths from `folders-structured.md` to ensure folder lock compliance.
Task reference: N/A
High-level reasoning: User requested update based on *all* files. This means merging the constraints of `ANTIGRAVITY.md` (env vars, strict structure) and `folders-structured.md` (exact paths) into the actionable checklist.
What changed: `task.md` tasks now include file paths and governance rules.
