User message: "task.md read kro then both info files read kro or phr task.md update kro"
Codex response summary: Read all requested files (+ folders-structured.md). Updated `task.md` to convert tasks to checkbox format `[ ]` and added missing folder structure tasks to Phase 0 based on `folders-structured.md`.
Task reference: N/A
High-level reasoning: User requested an update to `task.md` after reading context. I observed `task.md` was missing specific folder structure tasks and used bullet points instead of checklists. Corrected this to align with `INSTRUCTIONS.md` and the user's new file.
What changed: Updated `task.md` content.
