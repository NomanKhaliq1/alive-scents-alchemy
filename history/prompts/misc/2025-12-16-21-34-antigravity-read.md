User message: "now read this also 'ANTIGRAVITY.md'"
Codex response summary: Read `ANTIGRAVITY.md`. Acknowledged the strict operational guidelines, tech stack constraints, and folder structure locking.
Task reference: N/A
High-level reasoning: User explicitly requested reading the new governance file. I read it and am effectively "installing" these rules into my behavior. I will proceed with extreme caution and explicit permission for every step.
What changed: History log only. Goverance context updated.
