User message: "Schema.sql b generate krdo"
Codex response summary: Created `schema.sql` based on `infov1.md` data models. Includes tables for materials, inventory, formulas, batches, and finished stock with proper constraints and foreign keys.
Task reference: N/A
High-level reasoning: User requested schema generation. This is the "Next File" listed in `task.md`. I generated the SQL definitions strictly adhering to the "percent-only" rule for formulas and "bonding" status requirements.
What changed: Created `schema.sql`.
